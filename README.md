# dataloaden
this is the dataloader pattern library for a GraphQL server.
This library is built based on [`github.com/vektah/dataloaden`](//github.com/vektah/dataloaden).
Code generated with vektah/dataloaden then added type parameters.
This library is using type parameters, so needs Go 1.18 or later.
